# PyBer_Analysis.
## Project Overview

V. Isualize expects a summary analysis on the ride-sharing data by city type, showing through tables and a multiple-line graph how the data differs by city type in order to use insights in decision making for PyBer.

### Purpose

Through this project, the differences in ride-sharing among the different city types is presented:
- Total rides.
- Total drivers.
- Total fares. 
- Average fare per ride.
- Average fare per driver
- Total fare by city type. 


## Resources

- Data Source: city_data.csv & ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.12, Visual Studio Code, 1.71.2


## Results

In the following table, the average fare per ride by city type is shown:

Rural fare is above urban fare for around $10 USD and $4 USD for suburban fare. 

In the table below, a clear comparison of the three city types is presented.

It can be observed that the market in Urban cities is considerably larger than in Rural cities.

In the line graph, there can be observed the total fare by city type throughout the year. The Urban type being the bussiest of the three. It doubles the Suburban and is way larger than the rural.

## Summary & recommendations

Based on the analysis on Pyber information, Urban market is the greatest one. The amount of drivers in Rural areas are considerably less, however, it matches the demand. We can also observe that the average fare in rural is higher, matching the law of supply and offer. It is also presented that Suburban is in the middle, for both drivers and fares. My recommendation would be to further analysis data, customer behaviours can help PyBer to develop better strategies. By using statistics, hypothesis can even be built. Does rural type trips cover longer distances? No doubt, there's still a lot to know to design strategies to increase profit.
